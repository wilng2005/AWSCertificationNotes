Strong Compliance Governance{
	1. Take a holistic approach, 
	   and document all compliance requirements

	2. Design and implement control objectives to 
	   meet compliance requirements 

	3. Identify and document controls owned by all 
	   third parties

	4. Verify that all control objectives are met and that
	   all key controls are designed operating effectively.

}

Evaluating and Integrating AWS Controls{
	- Companies request and evaluate third-party attestations
	  and certifications in order to gain reasonable assurance of the
	  design and effectiveness of controls.	

	- Specfic Control Definition{
		SOC1 Type II Report{
			- SOC1 is an in-depth audit of both design
			  and operating effectiveness of AWS defined 
			  control objectives and activities
			
			- Type II means that each of the controls defined
			  in the report are evaluated not only for
			  adequacy of designed by also tested for
			  effectiveness by an external auditor.
		}

		- Fulfils compliance purposes, including Sarbanes-Oxley(SOX)
		  Section 404, and ISO 27001.

		- Auditors may request for a SOC 1 Type II report in-order
		  to complete evaluations for their customers.

	- General Control Standard Compliance {
	
		- Broad set of control objectives{

			- ISO 27001

			- PCI DSS for credit card related 
			
			- FISMA for compliance to Government Agencies
			
		}

AWS Global Regions {
	- Currently, AWS operates 33 AZs in 12 Regions
}

AWS Risk and Compliance Program{
	Risk Management{
		Business plan Risk{
			- Re-evaluated at least twice a year.
			- Team identify risks and implement controls to
			  address and eliminate the risk
		}	
		Risk Assessments{
			- Internal and external Risk assessments
			- Establish information security framework and policies
			  based on COBIT
			- Integratd ISO 27001, 27002, AICPA Trust Services 
			  Principles, PCI DSS v3.1, NIST Pub 800-53, 
			- Regular application security reviews to access
			  CIA
		}
		
		Regular scans of public-facing endpoints for vulnerabilities
		(but do not include customer instances)
		
		Independent security firms conduct external vulnerability threat
		assessments. (These scans are not meant to replace the customer's own
		vulnerability scans to meet compliance requirements.
		
		Customers must request permission to conduct their own vulnerability scans.

	}
	Control Environment{
		
		- Comprehensive control environment that consists of policies, processes
		  and control activities.

		- Management is on board.
		
		- New-comers are on-boarded properly.
	}

	Information Security{
		- Read white papers (-_-" )
