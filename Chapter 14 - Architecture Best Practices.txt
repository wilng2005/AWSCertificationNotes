Chapter 14 Architecture Best Practices{

	- Design for failure and nothing will fail{
		- Ensure that the application survives when the underlying physical
		  hardware fails

		- Introduce Redundancy{
			- standby redundancy tends to apply to 
		  	  stateful components such as databases
			
			- active redundancy is to distribute load to multiple resources
			
		}
	}

	- Implement Elasticity{
		- 



	}

	- Leverage different storage options{


	
	}

	- Build security in every layer {


	}

	- Think parallel{

	
	}

	- Loose coupling sets you free{


	}

	- Don't fear constraints{
